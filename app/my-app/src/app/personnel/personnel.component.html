<p class="text-left sorlingas-p2-indent">James Wright joined the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office in Taunton in 2007 to aid the AVCS (Admiralty Vector Chart Service) project. After a year specialising in electronic charting, he undertook the company's IHO accredited cartographic training and became a permanent member of staff.
James spent seven years working in various chart branches across the UKHO employing traditional charting methodology to produce both standard (SNC) and electronic (ENC) navigational charts. He would also assess incoming data (surveys, notices to mariners, H-Notes etc) to determine charting action and effect updates to Admiralty products where necessary.
In 2015 James moved to the Port of London Authority thus becoming the first specialist cartographer to be employed by a British Port. At the PLA, he worked within the Hydrographic Service to develop and support a folio of fully compliant ENCs as well as bENCs. He now maintains these key safety of navigation products through Sorlingas Data Services. 
James has previous experience of running a football book publishing business, and as a journalist. A former marathon runner and club tennis player, he now spends his spare time walking in the countryside, travelling with his wife, or watching Wolverhampton Wanderers or non-League football.

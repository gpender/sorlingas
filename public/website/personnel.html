                <h4>Managing Director - James Wright, MIMarEST</h4>
                <p class="mb-0">James Wright joined the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office in Taunton in 2007 to aid the AVCS
                  (Admiralty Vector Chart Service) project. After a year specialising in electronic charting, he undertook the
                  company's IHO accredited cartographic training and became a permanent member of staff. James spent seven
                  years working in various chart branches across the UKHO employing traditional charting methodology to
                  produce both standard (SNC) and electronic (ENC) navigational charts. He would also assess incoming data
                  (surveys, notices to mariners, H-Notes etc) to determine charting action and effect updates to Admiralty
                  products where necessary. In 2015 James moved to the Port of London Authority thus becoming the first
                  specialist cartographer to be employed by a British Port. At the PLA, he worked within the Hydrographic
                  Service to develop and support a folio of fully compliant ENCs as well as bENCs. He now maintains these key
                  safety of navigation products through Sorlingas Data Services. James has previous experience of running a
                  football book publishing business, and as a journalist. A former marathon runner and club tennis player, he
                  now spends his spare time walking in the countryside, sea swimming, travelling with his wife and watching local
                  sport.</p>

                <h4>Senior Cartographer - Pat Currah</h4>
                <p class="mb-0">Pat joined the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office 2007 as a Trainee Mapping & Charting Officer, enrolling onto their IHO
                accredited cartographic training course learning the skills required to produce and maintain standard paper charts. He
                joined the team responsible for charting Africa and the Mediterranean, quickly building experience across a broad range
                of data sources. Pat took a secondment into an ENC assessment team responsible for ingesting a global package of ENCs
                into the UKHO catalogue. Adding ENCs to his standard charting and GIS skills, he then moved into UKHO’s new Hydrographic
                Database team responsible for data assessment and chart production (paper and ENC) across the UK. Pat left UKHO in 2013
                to be nearer family in his native Cornwall, pursuing a career as an Operations Manager firstly in the Wastewater
                Industry and later within the Seafood Industry. Realising an ambition to return to Cartography, he has formed ‘Currah
                Mapping & Data Services’, working alongside Sorlingas to produce high quality navigational products and maintenance
                services.</p>

                      <h4>MARCH 12th 2021 – NEARLY 50M TONNES OF FREIGHT IN A YEAR</h4>
                      <p class="mb-0">Earlier this week the Office for National Statistics released the Department for Transport port trade statistics for 2020.
                        Handling a mammoth 47.4 million tonnes of cargo, the Port of London emerges as Britain's busiest port during 2020 with Grimsby & Immingham a close second on 45.6 million tonnes. Sorlingas Data Services maintained the Port of London's portfolio of ENCs and bENCs throughout their hectic year and continues to do so in 2021.
                        Within the Port of London, most traffic passes through the main lower river terminals operated by the London Gateway and the Port of Tilbury. The latter saw its capacity increased with the opening during the year of phase one the new Tilbury2 facility at the site of the recently demolished Tilbury Power Station.
                        All UK ports played a vital role in keeping the country fed, fuelled and supplied during the pandemic - a period further complicated by the Brexit transition. We congratulate our main client, and all other UK ports, on ensuring supplies are delivered uninterrupted to our shops, factories, forecourts and hospitals in these challenging times.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">In advance of the Algerciras’s historic passage, Sorlingas Data Services were commissioned by the Port of London Authority to produce its highest density Bathymetric Electronic Navigational (bENC) chart to date. We already help the Authority maintain a portfolio of over thirty 0.5m contour bENCs in key areas from the outer estuary to HMS Belfast. This coverage is now overlain at the Sunk by the new 0.25m contour product, and will be fuelled by an increased frequency of survey ensuring mega ships can continue to plan safe passage to LGW. The photos demonstrate two instances of 16.2m safety contour being set at the Sunk. In the first picture, the 0.5m bENC (1PB00251) is in use, so the safety contour snaps to 16.5m. However, where a 16.25m contour is deployed (second image, bENC 1PB0TE5A), more water is visibility available to vessels forced by draught to divert from the DW route.</p>

                      <h4>JUNE 24th 2020 – SORLINGAS PRODUCES NEW HIGHER DENSITY bENC</h4>
                      <p class="mb-0">With the world’s largest container ships now berthing at DP World’s London Gateway (witness the rightly feted arrival of HMM Algerciras earlier this month) increased scrutiny has fallen upon the Sunk area pinch point in the Thames estuary. Where a depth reduction of just one decimetre potentially shrinks the berthing window by up to by fifteen minutes, pilots are increasingly being forced to seek more water just off the charted Deep Water Route.</p>

                        <p class="mb-0">In advance of the Algerciras’s historic passage, Sorlingas Data Services were commissioned by the Port of London Authority to produce its highest density Bathymetric Electronic Navigational (bENC) chart to date. We already help the Authority maintain a portfolio of over thirty 0.5m contour bENCs in key areas from the outer estuary to HMS Belfast. This coverage is now overlain at the Sunk by the new 0.25m contour product, and will be fuelled by an increased frequency of survey ensuring mega ships can continue to plan safe passage to LGW. The photos demonstrate two instances of 16.2m safety contour being set at the Sunk. In the first picture, the 0.5m bENC (1PB00251) is in use, so the safety contour snaps to 16.5m. However, where a 16.25m contour is deployed (second image, bENC 1PB0TE5A), more water is visibility available to vessels forced by draught to divert from the DW route.</p>
